    <pre>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.
    It was commissioned in 1631 by the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself.
    The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</pre>
    <h3>Great Wall of China</h3>

    <pre>The Great Wall of China (traditional Chinese: 萬里長城; simplified Chinese: 万里长城; pinyin: Wànlǐ Chángchéng, literally "ten thousand li wall") is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe.
    Several walls were built from as early as the 7th century BC,[4] with selective stretches later joined by Qin Shi Huang (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains.[5] Later on, many successive dynasties built and maintained multiple stretches of border walls.
    The best-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).</pre>
    <h3>Huangshan</h3> <br/>

    <pre>Huangshan (Chinese: 黄山),[2] literally meaning the Yellow Mountain(s), is a mountain range in southern Anhui Province in eastern China. 
    It was originally called “Yishan”, and it was renamed because of a legend that Emperor Xuanyuan once made alchemy here.
    [3] Vegetation on the range is thickest below 1,100 meters (3,600 ft), with trees growing up to the treeline at 1,800 meters (5,900 ft).</pre>
    <h3>Tombo of Isa Khan</h3> <br/>
    <img src="gettyimages-489348944-612x612.jpg"/> <br/>
    <pre>The tomb of the noble Isa Khan Niazi is located in the Humayun's Tomb complex in Delhi, India.
    The mausoleum, octagonal in shape and built mainly of red sandstone, was built in 1547–1548 during the reign of Sher Shah Suri.
    The mosque of Isa Khan is located west of the mausoleum, which along with other buildings form the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Humayun's tomb complex.</pre>
    <h3>Ahu Tongariki Moai Statues </h3> <br/>
    <img src="gettyimages-1287355563-612x612.jpg"/> <br/>
    <pre>Ahu Tongariki (Spanish pronunciation: [ˈa.u toŋɡaˈɾiki]) is the largest ahu on Easter Island (Rapa Nui).
    Its moais were toppled during the island's civil wars, and in the twentieth century the ahu was swept inland by a tsunami.
    It has since been restored and has fifteen moai, including one that weighs eighty-six tonnes, the heaviest ever erected on the island. 
    Ahu Tongariki is one kilometer from Rano Raraku and Poike in the Hotu-iti area of Rapa Nui National Park. 
    All the moai here face sunset during the winter solstice.</pre>
    <h3>Stonehenge</h3>
    <img src="gettyimages-1364722615-1024x1024.jpg"/> <br/>
    <pre>Stonehenge, prehistoric stone circle monument, cemetery, and archaeological site located on Salisbury Plain, about 8 miles (13 km) north of Salisbury, Wiltshire, England.
     Though there is no definite evidence as to the intended purpose of Stonehenge, it was presumably a religious site and an expression of the power and wealth of the chieftains, aristocrats, and priests who had it built—many of whom were buried in the numerous barrows close by.</pre>
    <h3>Victoria Falls</h3>
    <img src="seven-wonders-of-the-natural-world-8.jpg"/> <br/>
    <pre>Also known as “The Smoke that Thunders,” Victoria Falls is located at the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe along the Zambezi River.
    It was named by Scottish explorer David Livingstone during his African voyage in 1855 after Queen Victoria of England.
    Its indigenous name, Mosi-oa-Tunya, also continues to be used and while the falls aren’t the world’s highest or widest, they are considered the largest. 
    With a width of 5,604 feet and height of 354 feet, Victoria Falls is the world’s largest sheet of falling water.</pre>
